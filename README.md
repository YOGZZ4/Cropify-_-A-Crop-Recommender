# Cropify-_-A-Crop-Recommender
This project entails the creation of a web platform where farmers can acquire crop recommendations and output forecasts.






Nitrogen -Phosphorus -Potassium -Nitrogen -Phosphorus -Potassium -Nitrogen -Phosphorus -Potassium -Nit -Rainfall -Humidity -pH Azure was chosen as the crop based on all of the above qualities. For model creation, I used Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, and for model construction, I used Automate ML. Several models were built, each one with a higher accuracy than the preceding one. The most accurate option was chosen, deployed, and endpoints were constructed.
I could have used Python FLASK and Azure web service to deploy them, but I don't have much experience with web development languages, and with just a few hours to turn the project on, I chose Node-RED to build the model's dashboard, and the web service was installed locally.
